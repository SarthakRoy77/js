Javascript is a programming language that is very famous.

How JS works???

"Everything in Javascript happens inside an Execution Context. "

Execution Content - Execution context is made up of two components called the "variable environment" and "Thread of Execution"
"Javascript is an synchronouse single threaded language"
Single- threaded meaning Javascript can only execute one command at a time while synchrous meaning in a specific order

How the code is executed??
1. Javascript skims through the whole program and allocates memory to the functions and variables(as undefined for var)
2. Javascript once agains sees the programs and runs it and in the space of "undefinite" it stores the actual value
